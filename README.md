👋 Hi, I’m Aastha Malhotra. Senior Data Analyst focused on enterprise-scale feature engineering and production data validation. I work primarily with SQL, Python, and Databricks to design customer-level feature frameworks, implement integration testing methodologies, and strengthen data governance across multi-million record datasets.

My experience includes authoring production-grade features, building reusable validation frameworks, conducting portfolio-level anomaly detection, and developing dashboard-ready analytics that support segmentation and performance tracking. I’m particularly interested in scalable analytics design, data integrity in production systems, and high-quality data modeling practices.

- Core Focus Areas:
  - Production-grade feature engineering
  - Integration & swap analysis
  - Data validation frameworks
  - KPI & dashboard enablement
  - SQL & Python-based analytics
